Hi! I'm Max and I am a second-year student at the University of Auckland. I study *Psychology* along with *Geographic information science* and take STATS220 as a part of my GISCI major. 

The purpose of this repo is to:

* Display the series of knowledge I have learnt through the course so far 🏫
* Provide a means by which I can portray my coding for my assignment 🖥️ 
* Show that data analysis is cool 😎

Make sure to check out this website I made ;) -> https://mnic03.github.io/stats220/
