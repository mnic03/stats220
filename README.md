# stats220

Hi! I'm Max and I am a second-year student at the University of Auckland. I study Psychology along with Geographic information science and take STATS220 as a part of my GISCI major. 

The purpose of this repo is to:

* Display the series of knowledge I have learnt through the course so far 🏫
* Provide a means by which I can portray my coding for my assignment 🖥️ 
* Show that data analysis is cool 😎
